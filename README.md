## Notes

FastAI
* progressive resizing = train a model at 64x64 then 128x128 then256x256
* start w/ a model that's already somewhat trained 
* if train loss > valid loss, you're underfitting.  try more epocs or training unfrozen at a lower learning rate

### GIS
* [National Map](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/) (geo data and imagery download)
* [GIS Geography](https://gisgeography.com/) (lots of good info on GIS)
* [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/gdal_translate.html) (geo data and imagery manilulation from command line)
* [Video: Intro to GDAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_dmiQI1s24)
* [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/index.html) (open source GIS software similar to ESRI)
